# Regarding threads...
# The SharedBroadcaster has:
# - UDP socket SelectorThread
# - UDP command processing
# - forever retrying search requests for disconnected PV
# The Context has:
# - process search results
# - TCP socket SelectorThread
# - restart subscriptions
# The VirtualCircuit has:
# - ThreadPoolExecutor for processing user callbacks on read, write, subscribe
