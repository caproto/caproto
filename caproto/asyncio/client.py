# This is a channel access client implemented using asyncio.

# It builds on the abstractions used in caproto, adding transport and some
# caches for matching requests with responses.
#
# VirtualCircuit: has a caproto.VirtualCircuit, a socket, and some caches.
# Channel: has a VirtualCircuit and a caproto.ClientChannel.
# Context: has a caproto.Broadcaster, a UDP socket, a cache of
#          search results and a cache of VirtualCircuits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    broadcaster : SharedBroadcaster, optional
        If None is specified, a fresh one is instantiated.

    timeout : number or None, optional
        Number of seconds before a CaprotoTimeoutError is raised. This default
        can be overridden at the PV level or for any given operation. If unset,
        the default is 2 seconds. If None, never timeout. A global timeout can
        be specified via an environment variable ``CAPROTO_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT``.

    host_name : string, optional
        uses value of ``socket.gethostname()`` by default

    client_name : string, optional
        uses value of ``getpass.getuser()`` by default

    max_workers : integer, optional
        Number of worker threaders *per VirtualCircuit* for executing user
        callbacks. Default is 1. For any number of workers, workers will
        receive updates in the order which they are received from the server.
        That is, work on each update will *begin* in sequential order.
        Work-scheduling internal to the user callback is outside caproto's
        control. If the number of workers is set to greater than 1, the work on
        each update may not *finish* in a deterministic order. For example, if
        workers are writing lines into a file, the only way to guarantee that
        the lines are ordered properly is to use only one worker. If ordering
        matters for your application, think carefully before increasing this
        value from 1.

        is added.

        Seconds since last message from the server that provides this channel.

        The time is reset to 0 whenever we receive a TCP message related to

        regular intervals. If we do not receive either a Beacon or TCP message,
        we initiate an Echo over TCP, to which the server is expected to
        promptly respond.

        Therefore, the time reported here should not much exceed

        environment variable) if the server is healthy.
