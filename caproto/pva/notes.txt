TODO

There are a few varieties of Serializable that need cleaning/distinguishing:
* FieldDescByte (stateful ctypes.structure - no cache required)
* FieldDesc (stateful, requires cache, has extra optional args)
* BitSet (stateful, does not require cache)
* DataSerializer (different, but needs to interact with the above)


New changes in the pvAccess documentation are not accounted for:
